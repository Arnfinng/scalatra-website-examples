# ScentryAuthDemo #

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd ScentryAuthDemo
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

Note: this example is incomplete. It does show some aspects of Scentry, but there are currently some problems with
this implementation.
